        <h2 class= start>Freelancing artist, Graphic Design Student</h2>

        <p class= demopara >Hello, my name is Sofia, I am a undergrad student, currently studying Advertising and Graphic design. I am more of an artist, I have been drawing for 10 years, and I have studied the basic assets of human anatomy. Yet, being a graphic designer is also fun to me, I like putting interesting Ideas into my projects, mainly because I enjoy the process of thinking creatively and also looking into the perspective of others and what catches someone's eye when they want to view art.</p>
        <p class= demopara>I have been studying Graphic design for about two years and a half so far, I want to be able to design my own logos for my own work someday. I also wish to be able to work for a good company who allows me to learn more and succeed after I graduate someday. </p>

          <h3 class= start>Logo Branding</h3>
          <img src="Logo 2.png" alt="Logo 2" class="center">
          <p class= demopara>This is one of my projects that was called the logo branding project! The main objective was to make up an ice cream brand and create a logo brand for this type of ice cream. I was at the mountains making S'mores when the Idea of a Sorbet S'mores ice cream came into mind!</p>
          <p class= demopara>I worked on the designing and rough drafts of this project, well, I did all of it, it was a school project after all. But I had a bunch of Ideas of the design until I came to the conclusion of  a simple typographic logo, with one letter having a chocolate piece, one having a marshmellow piece, and the rest being chocolate covered! I also added cracker borders on the top and bottom for the final look. I am proud of it.</p>
